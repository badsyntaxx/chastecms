Few contractors can match their structured cabling and wireless systems because they focus directly on designing and evolving their blueprint for the perfect LAN.</p>
                    <p class="row">The folks down at TCI are smart and wanted some customized functionality in their website. They wanted a web application, to do some calculations and help them, and their clients better prepare for projects. We wrote a bit of code and made them an app that could collect data for new projects and streamlined their process.</p>
