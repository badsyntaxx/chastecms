            <p class="text-large">Very often when business owners have trouble with their websites, they end up in a time consuming back and forth with a host and a developer. Add to that a third host for email and you have yourself a lot to deal with. Lets eliminate that headache by keeping your host and website developer one in the same.</p>

                <p>This service will benefit locals in particular. People using out of state hosting, know the fustration of trying to communicate with mainland vendors. The varying time zones can cause slow response times, and poor communication. Our team is based on the island of Oahu, so our response times are fast.</p>

                <p>We are very grateful to those that choose us as a host. That's why we offer reduced pricing on website creation for those who trust us to host their website. It is like choosing a home for your website after all, so why not choose one with a little aloha.</p>
